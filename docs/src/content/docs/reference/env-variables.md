Djazztro uses environment variables to configure the application. The following lists the environment variables used by Djazztro.

## ASTRO_PORT

The port to run the frontend on. Defaults to `3000`. Note this is **not** the port the backend runs on, meaning it's not the one you connect to.

## DJANGO_PORT

The port to run the backend on. Defaults to `8000`. This is the port you connect to.
