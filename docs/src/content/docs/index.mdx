## Why Djazztro?

<CardGrid stagger>
    <Card title="Best Of Both Worlds" icon="forward-slash">
        Djazztro combines the versatility and user-friendliness of Django's SSR and ORM and the
        speed and flexibility of Astro's SSG and component-based approach. And since it's built on
        top of Astro, you can use any of the thousands of NPM packages available, including React,
        Vue, and Svelte components.
    </Card>
    <Card title="No Production Overhead" icon="rocket">
        Djazztro builds the frontend of your site statically for production, so to Django the site
        is just a bunch of templates. Meaning no need to setup Astro or node in production.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Hot Module Reloading" icon="puzzle">
        You don't have to worry about giving up HMR on the frontend site
    </Card>
    <Card title="Easy to Setup" icon="star">
        Djazztro is easy to setup with the `create-djazztro` package. It lets you choose your
        favorite Node and Python package managers, and even lets you setup TypeScript, prettier,
        black, and more!
